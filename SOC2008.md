# About Your Mentors #

## What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible. ##

We will use the gelato developes as mentors.

We have asked core gelato committers whether they are interested to mentor students in an open call to the developers mailing list.

Our aim is to use them because they have the best development practices on the project and have been through the gelato process already and know the way around the project.

## Who will your mentors be? Please enter their Google Account address separated by commas. If your organization is accepted we will email each mentor to invite them to take part. (optional) ##

# About The Program #

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? ##

We hope to minimize the damage done by a missing student following the next steps:

  * Requiring continuos code updates.
  * requiring students to keep in touch.
  * The mentors will have the responsibility for their students, keeping track of what their students are up to.
  * Ask our students to provide means for us to get in touch beyond email, where possible - phone, etc - in case we need to get in touch urgently.
  * The student should have a clear way to indicate they are feeling lost or feel stuck, so that the mentor can help.
  * Provide plenty of help and encouragement to continue where required.
  * If a student actually decides to leave, the project will be taken on by somebody from the gelato team in the future.

## What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? ##

Our contigency plan is quite simple, we have a few close friends (freelancers, coders, etc) who have made sporadic contributions to the project, as backup mentors.We already asked them if they could act as a backup in different areas, in case any of the original mentors can't make it in time or decide to step down.

## What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program? ##

All of our mentors strongly encourage students to get involved on both the mailing list and the IRC channel, where most of the developers hang out. We hope to make them feel that they're an important part of our community; that their contributions are really making a difference towards the goals of gelato.

## What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes? ##

In addition to a constant interpersonal conversation, we will show them a few closed source alternatives similar to our project, and ask them if they can find features that we don't have (to fork out), technical and logical problems that we haven't solved yet, and community flaws that we haven't faced before.If we can show them a few good things about open source idea, their curiosity will do the rest.
